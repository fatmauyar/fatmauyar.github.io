* Created Predictive flow algorithm: discovers the relationship between brain regions based on their temporal sequences of activation using machine learning. [[Github]](https://github.com/fatmauyar/PredictiveFlow.git)  

* Analyzed one of the largest datasets for brain neuroimaging: 800+ participants, 220 temporal scans, 200K data point per scan (~ 1 TB)

**Techniques**: Matlab, Python, R, Jupyter, L1 regularized regression (LASSO)
