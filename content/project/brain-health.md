* Created multi-threaded parallel pipeline to analyze brain MRI images across multiple datasets (weight loss, Parkinsonâ€™s, childhood obesity); speeding up processing by 800%.

* Applied statistical mediation analysis to uncover causal links between fitness, aspects of brain health and cognitive function.


**Techniques**: Matlab, FSL, Freesurfer, gnu parallel, SPSS, mediation
