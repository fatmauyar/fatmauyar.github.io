In the present study, we examined whether CRF, measured as maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), and daily volume of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) were associated with IIV of reaction time during performance of the incongruent condition of the Stroop task in younger adults. Further, we examined whether the thickness of the cingulate cortex was associated with regulating variability in reaction time performance in the context of CRF or physical activity. CRF (measured as VO2max), accelerometry-measured MVPA, Stroop performance, and thickness of the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were collected in 48 younger adults (age = 24.58 ± 4.95 years, mean ± SD). Multiple regression was used to test associations between IIV during the Stroop task and CRF, MVPA, and rACC thickness. Mediation was tested using maximum likelihood estimation with bootstrapping. Consistent with our predictions, higher VO2max and greater daily amounts of MVPA were associated with greater rACC thickness. Greater thickness of the right rACC was associated with lower IIV for the incongruent condition of the Stroop task. CRF and MVPA were not directly associated with IIV. However, we did find that IIV and both CRF and MVPA were indirectly associated via the thickness of the right rACC. These results indicate that higher CRF and greater daily volume of MVPA may be associated with lower IIV during the Stroop task via structural integrity of the rACC. Randomized controlled trials of MVPA would provide crucial information about the causal relations between these variables.","tags":[],"title":"Associations between cardiorespiratory fitness, physical activity, intraindividual variability in behavior, and cingulate cortex in younger adults","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\u0026hellip;\n","date":1530158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530158400,"objectID":"18d05a63a1c8d7ed973cc51838494e41","permalink":"https://fatmauyar.github.io/privacy/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/privacy/","section":"","summary":"\u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Privacy Policy","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1519880400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1519880400,"objectID":"73593916605766b8b40ae439b9498e4f","permalink":"https://fatmauyar.github.io/publication/fitnessconnectivity/","publishdate":"2018-03-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/fitnessconnectivity/","section":"publication","summary":"Consistent associations have been found between higher cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and indices of enhanced brain health and function, including behavioral measures of cognition as well as neuroimaging indicators such as regional brain volume. Several studies have reported that higher CRF levels are associated with a larger hippocampus, yet associations between volume and memory or functional connectivity metrics remain poorly understood. Using a multi‐modal framework, we hierarchically examine the association between CRF and hippocampal volume and resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) in younger adults, as well as their relationship between with memory function. We conducted theoretically‐driven analyses with seeds in the anterior and posterior hippocampus, as well as control seeds in the caudate nucleus. We tested whether (1) hippocampal connectivity with prefrontal cortical regions was associated with CRF in an adult sample much younger than traditionally tested, (2) associations between CRF and rsFC remain significant after adjusting for volume, and (3) volume and rsFC are related to memory. We found that higher CRF levels were associated with larger anterior hippocampal volume and more positive rsFC of the anterior hippocampus to several regions including the prefrontal cortex. rsFC also accounted for significant variance in CRF, above and beyond volume. CRF can thus be independently linked to increased anterior hippocampal volume, as well as stronger hippocampal rsFC in a population much younger than those typically tested, suggesitng it is critical to maintainig multiple aspects of brain health.","tags":[],"title":"Cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with enhanced hippocampal functional connectivity in healthy young adults","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1498881600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1498881600,"objectID":"a5c807daae77c02824dbd1ccdd130b42","permalink":"https://fatmauyar.github.io/publication/cardiovascular/","publishdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/cardiovascular/","section":"publication","summary":"Individuals who exhibit large-magnitude blood pressure (BP) reactions to acute psychological stressors are at risk for hypertension and premature death by cardiovascular disease.

Growing recognition of the bidirectional connectivity of the visual system has challenged this view and recent empirical evidence suggests a more interactive and graded system. Here, based on findings from functional MRI in adult observers, in which meridians and category selective regions are localized and their activation sampled, we support this latter perspective by showing that category effects are present in retinotopic cortical areas and spatial position effects are present in higher-order regions. Furthermore, the results indicate that the retinotopic and later areas are functionally connected suggesting a possible mechanism by which these seemingly disparate effects come to be intermixed in both early and later regions of the visual system.","tags":[],"title":"Retinotopic information interacts with category selectivity in human ventral cortex","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1472702400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1472702400,"objectID":"7fef22cdb4aa454722a1b47cf56f3c8d","permalink":"https://fatmauyar.github.io/publication/physicalactivity/","publishdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/physicalactivity/","section":"publication","summary":"Accumulating evidence suggests that physical activity improves explicit memory and executive cognitive functioning at the extreme ends of the lifespan (i.e., in older adults and children).

Here we report the results of a study in which we examine the relationship between objectively measured physical activity and (1) explicit relational memory, (2) executive control, and (3) implicit probabilistic sequence learning in a sample of healthy, college-aged adults. The main finding was that physical activity was positively associated with explicit relational memory and executive control (replicating previous research), but negatively associated with implicit learning, particularly in females. These results raise the intriguing possibility that physical activity upregulates some cognitive processes, but downregulates others.

Recent theories suggest that this spatial attention deficit arises from structural/functional perturbation of the balance between the dorsal and ventral attentional networks. The consequence of the attentional imbalance on the sensory signals elicited in response to visual stimulation is not yet understood. Neglect offers a unique opportunity to examine direct consequences of attention on sensory processing by measuring behavioral and neural responses to a stimulus presented in the unaffected right side of space as compared to the same stimulus presented to the affected left side of space. Here, we compared neural signals elicited in response to the attended and neglected visual stimulation in patients with right parietal lobe lesions and intact occipital and temporal cortex. FMRI was used to localize four visual field locations in sensory regions V1-V4, FFA, and PPA. In addition, patients performed a fixation task while task-irrelevant images of faces and houses were presented in 4 locations. Univariate analysis showed greater difference between the preferred and non-preferred stimuli as one moves anteriorly from V1, V2, V3, V4, to PPA, and FFA, in left versus right hemisphere. The reduction of right hemisphere response to preferred stimuli was correlated with the severity of neglect. The signal integrity within the two hemispheres was tested separately with multivariate analysis. Category and location information in right hemisphere ROIs was lower as compared to the left hemisphere as evidenced by lower within-category cross correlation coefficients and classification accuracies. These results provide evidence that attention directly affects perceptual processing by improving the integrity of sensory responses elicited in visual cortex via magnifying the difference between the response to preferred and non-preferred stimuli.","tags":[],"title":"Sensory Processing with Varying Degrees of Attention: Lessons from Hemispatial Neglect","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1333252800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1333252800,"objectID":"fc7ccae9e266b438a68e3d5019f6f539","permalink":"https://fatmauyar.github.io/publication/graingrowth/","publishdate":"2012-04-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/graingrowth/","section":"publication","summary":"During anisotropic curvature driven grain growth, high-energy grain boundaries are preferentially eliminated, thus leading to interface texture development and a higher population of low energy grain boundaries.

To model these effects, a three dimensional anisotropic multi- level set model was modified in order to account for the effect of stress field on grain growth. For this mesoscale study, grain boundaries were treated as dislocation structures and their associated net Burgers vectors were calculated using the misorientation information and boundary inclinations. Using these net Burgers vectors and their associated densities, additional forces due to stress field were calculated via the Peach-Koehler equation.
